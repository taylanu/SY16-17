/* A Set is simply a Collection in which duplicates are not allowed. 
In a Map, each element consists of a unique key and a value.
In a TreeMap, the elements are organized in a balanced and ordered tree, ordered by the keys. 
In a HashMap, the elements are organized in a hash table determined by the Object's hashCode(). 
A HashSet can be thought of as a HashMap in which each element has the same dummy value.
A TreeSet can be thought of as a TreeMap in which each element has the same dummy value.

-> boolean add(Object x);			//boolean for successful add
-> boolean contains (Object x);	//search for x in the Set
-> boolean remove (Object x);		//boolean for successful remove
-> int size();							//the number of elements
-> Iterator iterator();				//to traverse the set
-> Object[] toArray();				//copies Set objects into an array which is returned

class java.util.HashSet implements java.util.Set
//places Objects into a set by their hashCode() method

interface java.util.Map
-> Object put(Object key, Object value);	//adds unique key maped to value
-> Object get(object key);						//returns value associated with key
-> Object remove (Object key);				//returns value removed
-> int size();										//the number of elements
-> Set keySet();									//returns a set of all the keys
