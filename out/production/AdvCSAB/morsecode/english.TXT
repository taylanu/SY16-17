I built a little empire out of some crazy garbage
called the blood of the exploited working class.
But they've overcome their shyness,
Now they're calling me your highness,
And a world screams, "kiss me, son of God".
I destroyed a bond of friendship and respect
Between the only people left who'd even look me in the eye.
Now I laugh and make a fortune
Off the same ones that i tortured
And a world screams, "kiss me, son of God".
I look like Jesus, so they say
But Mr. Jesus is very far away
Now you're the only one here who can tell me if it's true
That you love me and i love me.
I built a little empire out of some crazy garbage
Called the blood of the exploited working class.
But they've overcome their shyness,
Now they're calling me your highness,
And a world screams, "kiss me, son of God".
Yes a world screams, "kiss me, son of God".
