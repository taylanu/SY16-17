MASH, MANGLE, MUNCH!

Play as a giant monster as you stomp on tanks, throw cars into buildings and swat news helicopters out of the air.
Your monster set includes:

King Clunk:  the result of genetic experiments gone wrong, King Clunk is a giant ape that ended up as a circus exibit.
Tired of his tormenters, King Clunk escaped from his captors to wreak havoc on the metropolis.
Clunk is the fastest of the monsters, and can pick up cars and buses to use as projectile weapons against enemy units or buildings.
Being ambidextorous, King Clunk can grab, hold and throw enemy units with both hands.
He can't swim very well, and will start to drown if in the water too long.
Crowds of people offer the best nutrients to keep him going and regain health, but a car, news helicopter or bus will do in a pinch.

Gobzilly:  awaken from her ancient slumber from the bottom of the sea, Gobzilly is a menace from a past long gone.
Slow on land, fast in the water and with destruction on her mind, Gobzilly can breathe fire to destroy enemy units or light structures ablaze.
Food will only curb her appetite and not restore health.  Only the water can regenenerate her if she is not weakened from hunger.
Gobzilly is best served by sticking close to the water, and knowing when to retreat.

Boobootron:  a robotic visitor from another world, Boobootron is lost, confused and growing more irritated by the minute.
He has a powerful death ray that can rotate in any direction, and is well adept at stomping on buildings.
But far removed from his homeworld and core power-source, Boobootron is losing energy by the moment.
He can only regain energy by absorbing power stations, electrical towers and trains.

WoeMantis:  oil-drillers on a newly discovered island found the WoeMantis nest and stole her eggs.
Mom is now out on a frantic mission to find her children and wreck anything that gets in her way.
The WoeMantis is fast, can fly, and has a powerful shriek that can stun ground enemies.
But the WoeMantis is much more vulnerable to projectile and explosive attacks, and she can't swim very well.
While the WoeMantis does not have much stomp ability, she lands with a powerful thud, and can easily stun and capture food.
The jump button can be used to take off in flight, as well as land on the ground.
Be careful in flight - while it is a fast way to get around, all armed units will be able to see and shoot at you while flying.

The Blop:  the offspring of the Bird Flu and the Superbug, the Blop was disposed of by the CDC in a vat of toxic waste.
Growing to enormous size with an insatiable appetite, the amorphous mass is out to punish its makers.
The Blop leaves a trail of toxic sludge wherever it goes, so it must be careful when making tracks.
It can trap victims to eat, but lay waste to too much space and the food will never come back.
If the Blop is at full health, it can split into two, but at the expense of damaging itself.
If it gets close enough to its twin, it can recombine into a single monster to regain health.

Wormoid:  while fracking for natural gas, the Shadow Government Energy Conglomerate (SGEC) disturbed the subteranian nest of Wormoid.
Agitated by the noise pollution from SGEC's drilling and pounding, Wormoid is out to silence her noisy neighbors upstairs.
Wormoid can not jump, but she sure can dig: rendering her invisible to unsuspecting civilians or the pesky military machines.
But be careful not to dig under electrical towers, gas stations or water:  Wormoid can't swim, and is vulnerable to electricity and fire.
Wormoid has no arms, but she can spit a sticky web to trap food for later.  Her web has another nifty function:
Chain a web between two close towers to create a trap for low-flying aircraft.

KEYBOARD CONTROLS (tap keys - do not hold down):

movement:		arrow keys (up, left, down, right) 
			Or move mouse in a location relative to where you want to move the monster.

			Moving the cursor further away and the monster will walk in that direction.
			Put the mouse in motion for the monster to move.
shoot/throw:		Enter or mouse left click (this will split the Blop if it is at full health, or recombine them if they are close enough)
eat:			Shift
grab:			Ctrl
jump/stomp:		Space or mouse right click.  You can not stomp or jump while moving.
turn head:		<, > (turn head left, turn head right), or use the center mouse wheel

quit:			Esc
restart:		r
pause:			p
toggle map/keys:	m
			You can see the key assignments to control the player, or toggle a map.
   			In the map, the red dot represents where you are with respect to the 9 grid panels.
			Gray areas represent dense city, green areas are suburbs.
			Rivers, beaches and railroad tracks are marked, and landmarks are shown with a white "L".
			The grid block will darken when an area has so much damage it is no longer habitable.

p2 shoot/throw:		c
p2 eat:			E
p2 grab:		G
p2 jump/stomp:		T
p2 turn head:		Z,X (turn head left, turn head right)
p2 shoot air targets:	T + C

A second player can join as a vehicle.

p2 movement:		W,A,S,D (up, left, down, right)
p2 fire:		c
p2 rotate cannon:	Z,X (rotate left, rotate right)

You can add another AI monster as well.  

toggle AI monster:      3 (In MONSTER MASH, this will remove the possibility of getting on the highscore table)

More potent enemy units will appear as more damage is done and the threat level increases.
Responders include:  Local police, National Guard, the Army, the Government.
When the government gets involved, they can approve the use of the atomic bomb to stop the monster.
If a black bomber appears, you have to strike it down before it reaches the end of the grid or escape to another grid.

Some units can not see you if you are hiding in buildings.  Destroying all of them may not serve you well all of the time.
The artillery cannon, aricraft, coast guard gunboat, mobile missle launcher and destroyer are tracking your location:  buildings will not hide you from them.
You can also use buildings to help absorb incoming fire from missiles and artillery shells.

The wind direction can effect the spread of fires, so mind the wind to maximize damage.
Use your ability to turn your head to move one way and shoot another.  This is a great way to deal damage to enemy units while avoiding incoming fire.  Take care of firetrucks early before they undo your hard work.

Grabbing a cluster of running civilians can be tricky.  There is a chance you will smash them in the attempt.  
The safest way to grab a crowd or a car is to grab them from behind as they are running away from you.
Consider saving some of the food you pick up to eat for later.  Having a few army troops in one claw can come in handy when injured or weakened.
King Clunk has an advantage in that he can hold crowds and vehicles in both hands.  The Blop has an advantage in that it can reach and eat almost anything.

The randomly generated world might include a landmark structure:  destroying it will deal massive property value damage, but immediately raise the threat response.  Prebuilt maps might contain several landmarks.
Likewise, there may be a fuel depot and gas stations that will explode if damaged too heavily.  Try to avoid stomping on them.
There is a chance that the world will include specialty areas, like suburbs, a carnival or a casino district.

Prebuilt cities include Las Vegas, London, New York City, St Louis, Settle and Washington DC.

Enemy units:

Threat response: ?
CROWD civilian: 	all they can do is run, and provide nutrients for the monster

CAR civilian:   	good for a snack, and can be used as a projectile for King-Clunk
CAR bus:		also projectile ammo, and a bit more nutrients when eaten
CAR firetruck:		often dispatched when there is a fire and puts them out, and hoses away Blop-glop off the streets to boot
AIR newscopter: 	in their effort to get a good picture for the papers, newscopters fly just low enough to grab
AIR civilian:		slow enough for The-Glop to catch
BOAT civilian:		yuppie niblets

Threat response: Local Police
CYCLE police:		a police officer on a motorcycle with a gun.  What else would you expect?
CAR police:		a little slower, but will pepper you with bullets

Threat response: National Guard
CAR jeep:		it has a rotating, mounted machinegun in the back
CROWD troops:		delicious, but deadly.  They will not be shy about shooting at you
BOAT coastguard:	they are tracking your movements, and have a hefty mounted gun on the bridge

Threat level: US Military
Tank tank:		slow moving with a rotating cannon and powerful shells
AIR fighter:		fast, with stinging missiles.  The fighter plane can see you when you are hiding behind buildings.

ALTERNATE GAME MODES -
BOMBER DODGER:  the cities have been evacuated, and the military is taking a last-ditch effort to stop the monster.

		You only have one city zone to protect, but with every building that a monster destroys, the city's property value decreases.
