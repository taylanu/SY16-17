Spanning Tree Protocol
Takes broadcast frames and propogates them across

STP works out of the box. Have to configure to stop from message loops.
If mac address is same on both root and bridge, then the switch is in fact the root bridge.

To select a new root, manually lower the priority of the spanning tree root.
