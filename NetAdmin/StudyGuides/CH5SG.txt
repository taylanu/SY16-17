5.1 IP Configuration
IP Addresses operate at Layer 3 of the OSI Model (Network). Unique hosts are assigned unique IP addresses on the network.
Each portion of an IP address is an octet consisting of 8 bits. Values from 0-255.
Subnet masks also have 4 octets, where first 2  identify the subnet and the second two identify the host.
5 IP Address Classes; each identified by first octet.
Class A: 1-126 255.0.0.0; Class B: 128-191 255.255.0.0; Class C: 192-223 255.255.255.0
Class D: 224-239 (multicast, used with multiple hosts); Class E 240-255 (experimental IPs only). These classes do not have specified subnet masks.

Broadcast Address (255) cannot be assigned to a host, but rather can only be a part of the subnet mask.
